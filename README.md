# Statistics-projects

Welcome to the Statistics Projects repository! This repository contains projects related to statistics and data analysis. 
Within this repository, you will find projects that focus on calculating probabilities and estimating outputs of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems.

#Probability Calculation for Student Grades

The Probability Calculation for Student Grades project aims to determine the probability that a student will achieve an 80% grade, 
given that they have missed more than 10 classes. This project utilizes statistical techniques and data analysis to calculate the 
likelihood of a student achieving a specific grade under certain conditions. The Python code included in this project performs the 
necessary calculations and provides insights into the probability estimation process.

#Estimation of Impulse Output of LTI System using AWGN

The Estimation of Impulse Output of LTI System using AWGN project focuses on estimating the impulse response output of a 
Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). This project utilizes statistical methods 
to estimate the response of the system to an impulse input in the presence of random noise. The Python code included in this project 
implements the necessary algorithms for estimating the output of the LTI system and provides a practical demonstration of the estimation process.

#Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each project. Each project folder contains the relevant source code files, 
along with any additional resources or documentation specific to that project. Feel free to explore the folders and review the code 
and accompanying materials for a deeper understanding of the statistical concepts and techniques employed in each project.

Thank you for your interest in the Statistics Projects repository. I hope these projects provide valuable insights into the application 
of statistical techniques and inspire further exploration in this fascinating field.
